            The transport of heat and salt through turbulent ice shelf–ocean boundary layers is a large source of uncertainty within ocean models of ice shelf cavities. This study uses small-scale, high-resolution, 3D numerical simulations to model an idealized boundary layer beneath a melting ice shelf to investigate the influence of ambient turbulence on double-diffusive convection (i.e., convection driven by the difference in diffusivities between salinity and temperature). Isotropic turbulence is forced throughout the simulations and the temperature and salinity are initialized with homogeneous values similar to observations. The initial temperature and the strength of forced turbulence are varied as controlling parameters within an oceanographically relevant parameter space. Two contrasting regimes are identified. In one regime double-diffusive convection dominates, and in the other convection is inhibited by the forced turbulence. The convective regime occurs for high temperatures and low turbulence levels, where it is long lived and affects the flow, melt rate, and melt pattern. A criterion for identifying convection in terms of the temperature and salinity profiles, and the turbulent dissipation rate, is proposed. This criterion may be applied to observations and theoretical models to quantify the effect of double-diffusive convection on ice shelf melt rates.},

              Double diffusion refers to a variety of turbulent processes in which potential energy is released into kinetic energy, made possible in the ocean by the difference in molecular diffusivities between salinity and temperature. Here, we present a new method for estimating the kinetic energy dissipation rates forced by double‐diffusive convection using temperature and salinity data alone. The method estimates the up‐gradient diapycnal buoyancy flux associated with double diffusion, which is hypothesized to balance the dissipation rate. To calculate the temperature and salinity gradients on small scales we apply a canonical scaling for compensated thermohaline variance (or ‘spice’) on sub‐measurement scales with a fixed buoyancy gradient. Our predicted dissipation rates compare favorably with microstructure measurements collected in the Chukchi Sea. Fine et al. (2018),

              Understanding the transport of heat in the Arctic Ocean is vital for predicting the fate of sea‐ice in the decades to come. Small‐scale turbulence is an important driver of heat transport and one of the major forms of this turbulence is known as ‘double‐diffusive convection’. This is where gradients in temperature and salinity drive turbulence. It is only possible because salinity diffuses significantly slower than temperature, hence the name ‘double‐diffusive’. The most direct measurements of ocean mixing require sampling velocity or temperature gradients on scales {\textless}1 mm, so‐called microstructure measurements. Here we present a new method for estimating the energy dissipated by double‐diffusive convection using temperature and salinity measurements on larger scales (100s–1000s of metres). We apply the method to a high‐resolution survey of temperature and salinity through a subsurface Arctic eddy and compare the results with simultaneous microstructure measurements. The new technique can reproduce up to 72
              \%
              of the observed dissipation rates to within the measurement uncertainty. This suggests the method could be used to estimate the dissipation and so heat fluxes associated with double‐diffusive convection in regions without microstructure measurements. The method also performs well when applied to data sub‐sampled on larger scales.

            The Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment (S-MODE) is a NASA Earth Ventures Suborbital investigation designed to test the hypothesis that oceanic frontogenesis and the kilometer-scale (“submesoscale”) instabilities that accompany it make important contributions to vertical exchange of climate and biological variables in the upper ocean. These processes have been difficult to resolve in observations, making model validation challenging. A necessary step toward testing the hypothesis was to make accurate measurements of upper-ocean velocity fields over a broad range of scales and to relate them to the observed variability of vertical transport and surface forcing. A further goal was to examine the relationship between surface velocity, temperature, and chlorophyll measured by remote sensing and their depth-dependent distributions, within and beneath the surface boundary layer. To achieve these goals, we used aircraft-based remote sensing, satellite remote sensing, ships, drifter deployments, and a fleet of autonomous vehicles. The observational component of S-MODE consisted of three campaigns, all conducted in the Pacific Ocean approximately 100-km west of San Francisco during 2021–23 fall and spring. S-MODE was enabled by recent developments in remote sensing technology that allowed operational airborne observation of ocean surface velocity fields and by advances in autonomous instrumentation that allowed coordinated sampling with dozens of uncrewed vehicles at sea. The coordinated use of remote sensing measurements from three aircraft with arrays of remotely operated vehicles and other in situ measurements is a major novelty of S-MODE.

            Warmer and more persistent intrusions of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) onto the West Antarctic Peninsula are a key driver of the recent increase in ice shelf mass loss. The relatively warm and salty CDW is thought to be mixed up to the base of the ice shelves via shear‐driven turbulence where it has a high capacity to melt the ice. We analyze data from a year‐long mooring beneath George VI Ice Shelf at a location where double‐diffusive layering was observed. The turbulent dissipation rates do not vary with mean flow speed, suggesting shear‐driven mixing is not the driver of basal melt at this site. Instead, we predict the observed dissipation using a new method that links along‐isopycnal stirring of temperature anomalies with double‐diffusive convection. Our work suggests that along‐isopycnal temperature variance may be a stronger indicator of melt than flow speed within strongly stratified ice shelf‐ocean boundary layers.

            Plain Language Summary
            Recently, warmer water has reached West Antarctic ice shelves (the floating extensions of the ice sheet), for longer periods, leading to an increased ice melt. Predicting how changing ocean conditions alter melting is key to understanding the response of the Antarctic ice sheet to global warming, which affects the extent of sea‐level rise. Basal melting is enhanced when warm and salty water is mixed up to the base of the ice. Often this mixing is forced by turbulence driven by the movement of water past the ice base. In this paper we analyze a year‐long mooring data set beneath George VI Ice Shelf and find that the measured turbulence does not correlate with the flow speed. We find instead that the turbulence can be explained by variations in temperature and salinity. These variations in temperature and salinity can create unstable density gradients due to the different rates of molecular diffusion between heat and salt, hence the name "double diffusion’. Unstable gradients in density can then force turbulence that mixes heat and salt up to the ice. If the mixing of heat and salt depends temperature and salinity variations rather than flow speed, it may affect predictions of ice melt.

              Pacific Summer Water eddies and intrusions transport heat and salt from boundary regions into the western Arctic basin. Here we examine concurrent effects of lateral stirring and vertical mixing using microstructure data collected within a Pacific Summer Water intrusion with a length scale of ∼20 km. This intrusion was characterized by complex thermohaline structure in which warm Pacific Summer Water interleaved in alternating layers of
              
              m thickness with cooler water, due to lateral stirring and intrusive processes. Along interfaces between warm/salty and cold/freshwater masses, the density ratio was favorable to double-diffusive processes. The rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (
              ε
              ) was elevated along the interleaving surfaces, with values up to 3 × 10

            Mesoscale warm‐core rings, known as Loop Current rings (LCRs) reshape the Gulf of Mexico water masses by redistributing large amounts of heat and salt laterally. LCRs also transform water masses via diapycnal mixing, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly measured. Here, we present glider‐MicroPod turbulence observations that reveal enhanced mixing below the mixed layer, along the eddy edges, driving the LCR's heat, salt, and oxygen exchanges. Interleavings of adjacent water masses may be interpreted mainly as a manifestation of submesoscale processes through stirring of the spice gradients, which facilitates double‐diffusive mixing that transforms Subtropical Underwater into Gulf Common Water. Our findings highlight the need for ocean models to parameterize double‐diffusive mixing processes directly resulting from submesoscale tracer stirring, which may be important at basin scale in the presence of LCRs in the Gulf of Mexico.

            Plain Language Summary
            In the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), anticyclonic eddies, known as Loop Current rings (LCRs) carrying warm and salty water shape the basin's water mass properties, which in turn, affects the regional climate and marine life. The water mass properties are altered by turbulent mixing. However, the mechanisms leading to the mixing of GoM waters are still under debate due to a lack of observations. Here, we use an autonomous underwater vehicle (glider) equipped with a turbulence sensor to assess the nature of LCR mixing and its impact on water properties. The breaking of internal waves in the ocean is often thought to be responsible for turbulent mixing in the ocean interior. However, our findings demonstrate that a process called double‐diffusive convection is responsible, where turbulence is forced by differences between the temperature and salinity of adjacent water parcels. We found that double‐diffusive convection was the main driver in mixing heat, salt, and oxygen along the eddy edges, producing Gulf Common Water. These findings highlight the need to include double diffusive processes in ocean models for more accurate simulations.

	abstract = {Abstract. Continuous moored time series of temperature, salinity, pressure and current speed and direction are of great importance for understanding the continental shelf and under-ice-shelf dynamics and thermodynamics that govern water mass transformations and ice melting in and around Antarctic marginal seas. In these regions, icebergs and sea ice make ship-based mooring deployment and recovery challenging. Nevertheless, over decades, expeditions around the fringe of Antarctica sporadically deployed and recovered hundreds of moored instruments, including those facilitated through ice shelves boreholes. These datasets tend to be archived in a wide range of data centres, with, to our knowledge, no clear format standardisation. As a result, systematic analysis of historical mooring time series in the marginal seas is often challenging. Here we present the first version of a standardised pan-Antarctic moored hydrography and current time series compilation, with broad international contributions from data centres, research institutes and individual data owners. The mooring records in this compilation span over five decades, from the 1970s to the 2020s, providing an opportunity for a systematic study of the pan-Antarctic water mass transport and shelf connectivity. As a demonstration of the utility of this compilation, we present spectral analysis of the compiled current velocity time series, which unsurprisingly shows the dominating presence of tidal variability within most records. This component of the variability is fitted using multi-linear regression to tidal frequencies, and the tidal fit is removed from the original time series to leave de-tided variability. Given the limited record durations to months to years, de-tided variability is dominated by synoptic (3–10 d period), intraseasonal (10–80 d) and seasonal (∼6 months–1 year) signals. The spatial distribution of the kinetic energy integrated within frequency bands is presented and discussed within respective regional contexts, and future avenues of research are proposed. This data compilation is assembled under the endorsement of Ocean-Cryosphere Exchanges in ANtarctica: Impacts on Climate and the Earth System (OCEAN ICE) project (https://ocean-ice.eu/, last access: 23 October 2025) funded by the European Commission and UK Research and Innovation. It is available and regularly updated in NetCDF format with the SEANOE database at https://doi.org/10.17882/99922 (Zhou et al., 2024a).},
